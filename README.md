2. One original white patch cable is missing. replaced with a third party cable.
3. Come with original packaging including patch cable, power adapter, eurorack power cable, User mabual, Behringer sticker
4. I wrapped it in white because I don't like the original design. The leds could shine through the wrap in darkroom so I didn't bother making tiny holes for it.
